# SAMS-GAN: Self-Attentive MultiSPADE  <br/> for Video Virtual Try-on

This repository contains the code for our paper at WACV... PAPER AND WEBSITE LINK.

Key Contributions:
- SAMS-GAN (a generative adversarial model)
- SAMS ResBlock (sequence of layers)
- Self-Attentive MultiSPADE normalization (single layer that combines several image annotations)

## Results

Some cool media COMING SOON.

### Acknowledgements
- This code was originally based on Sergey Wong's CP-VTON repository. Thanks very much
for their hard work.
- Thank you Haoye Dong and his team for hosting the VUHCS competition at CVPR 2020, and
for providing the VVT Dataset and FW-GAN reference code.
